### MARDU (Dragonform) - Attack with your draconic blood!
If your opponent is below half of their life, your creatures will smell their blood and open their claws and wings to finish the task.
### TEMUR (Earthshake) - Awake the lands!
Enhance your lands with magic. They will grow and for that turn will wake up to attack your enemies or defend you from their creatures.
### ABZAN (False Faith) - Pray for enchantments!
If you have an enchantment of the color that card demands, their faith will reward you with more power.
### JESKAI (Combo) - 2 is the magic number!
When you cast a combo instant or sorcery, if it was the second instant or sorcery you've casted this turn, make it double.
### SULTAI (Flood) - Flood your opponents lands with their tears!
As an alternative, you can flood a card under an opponent land. If you do, that land will lose every power and instead give one colorless mana.
